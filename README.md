# Netflix-Movie-Analysis
In this project, I aim to analyze movies that are available on Netflix to gain insights into their release patterns. I plan to investigate the days and months when Netflix releases its movies, as well as the difference between the number of movies released and the number of movies added to the platform. I also plan to explore the types of movie ratings that are available on Netflix and identify the countries that contribute to the content available on the platform. By analyzing these factors, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the movie landscape on Netflix and uncover patterns that can provide valuable insights.
